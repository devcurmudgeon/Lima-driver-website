Welcome to the Lima Driver open source project. Lima Driver aims to provide open source driver software for the ARM Mali chipset.

You can join the conversation at #lima on freenode, and there is a mailinglist for developers interested in using or keeping up to date with the project.

Lima Driver is a new project - documentation is incomplete and likely to change.

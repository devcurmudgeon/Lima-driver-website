# **Lima**: An open source graphics driver for ARM Mali GPUs
===

Lima is an open source graphics driver which supports Mali-200 and Mali-400 GPUs. 

The aim of this driver is to finally bring all the advantages of open source software to ARM SoC graphics drivers. Currently, the sole availability of binary drivers is increasing development and maintenance overhead, while also reducing portability, compatibility and limiting choice. Anyone who has dealt with GPU support on ARM, be it for a linux with a GNU stack, or for an android, knows the pain of dealing with these binaries. Lima is going to solve this for you, but some time is needed still to get there.


## Software
===

In order to keep things manageable, no code will be made available until shortly after FOSDEM 2012, where the [Lima driver project will be officially announced.](http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/event/mali "Liberating ARM's Mali GPU")

## Contact
===

We can currently be reached on irc on [freenode](http://freenode.net/), in the #lima channel.

A mailinglist [was recently requested at fd.o](https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45232), but has not been created yet.
